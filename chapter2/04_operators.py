# Arithmetic Operators
a = 34

# Assignment Operators
a = 4-2 # Assign 4-2 in a
print(a)
# b = 6
b += 3 # Increment the value of b by 3 and then assign it to b
b -= 3 # Decrement the value of b by 3 and then assign it to b
print(b)

# Comparison Operator
d = 5==5
print(d) # It returns always boolean <=, >=, -=, +=, *=, /=, !=, ==
# A=5 means you are assigning value 5 to A.
# 5==5 means you are declaring the value of 5 is 5.

# Logical operators
# TT of 'or':
