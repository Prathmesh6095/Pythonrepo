# Write a program to find out whether a given post is talking about "Harry" or not
post = "Heyy harry is good, harry is very smart"

if("Harry".lower() in post.lower()): # lower() helps to convert post in lower form to find Harry even without capitalize form 
    print("This post is talking about Harry")

# "Harry" and "harry" both are different because of case sensitiveness
